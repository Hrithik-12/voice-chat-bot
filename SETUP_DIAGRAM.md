# Adding the Architecture Diagram

To complete the README setup, please add your architecture diagram image:

## Option 1: Local Image (Recommended for testing)

1. Save your diagram image as `architecture-diagram.png`
2. Place it in the `public/` folder
3. The README will reference it as `/architecture-diagram.png`

## Option 2: GitHub URL (Recommended for production)

1. Save your diagram image as `architecture-diagram.png`
2. Place it in the root of the repository (same level as README.md)
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. The README already references it at:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hrithik-12/voice-chat-bot/main/architecture-diagram.png
   ```

## Current Image

You can save the diagram from your conversation as `architecture-diagram.png`

The diagram shows:
- Client (React Component)
- Media/Record API
- Web Speech API
- API Route Handler
- Server
- AssemblyAI
- GeminiAI

With the complete flow from user interaction through to speech synthesis.
